This zip file contains all the raw data  relevant to the structure based SUMOylation site prediction.

Information about dataset used in this study can be found in the file named lysine_mappings_for_training_dataset.tsv.

Information about all the atomic contacts between Ubc9 and target proteins are also provided. File named vdw_sumo_at_4A.txt contains atomic contact data for SUMOylated lysines whereas the file named vdw_non_sumo_at_4A.txt contains data for atomic contact data for non-SUMOylated lysines.

The file named size_3_respair_sets_enriched_in_sumi_poses.tsv contains information about all the residue contacts used for making predictions.

Information about lysines predicted as true positives and false positives has been given in files named true_positive_predictions.txt and false_positive_predictions.txt.

The folder GO_term_analysis contains information about Gene Ontology terms enriched in the proteins used in this study. All these terms are sorted in the descending order of their frequencies / probabilities.

File named CATH_mappings_for_training_dataset.tsv contains information about different CATH folds present in the proteins used in this study.

File named prediction_results_obtained_for_different_sets.png contains a table describing details of predictions made using res-pair sets of sizes varying from 1 to 18.
